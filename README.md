# WebdriverIO/Mocha Basic Repository

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/klamping/wdio-mocha-basic.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a very simple WebdriverIO repository meant as a starting point for more complex setups. Useful to help isolate errors and show off simple examples.

## Usage

```
git clone git://github.com/klamping/wdio.git && rm -rf wdio/.git
```

This will clone a copy, without keeping the original git information (which probably isn't needed). 

## What it contains:

- NPM set up and wdio installed with mocha
- wdio config file set up
- Simple Node.js .gitignore file
- test script folder with example file

## Why not to use it

- You already have a package.json folder in your root project directory, in which case you should go through the normal WDIO install process.
